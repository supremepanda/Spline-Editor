## Introduction
There are a lot of spline editor examples for Unity editor. Because it is a very good practice to learn about computer graphics topic of spline. I used Hermite Curve calculation for this spline editor. In this project, unlike the others, I tried to write as cleanly as possible and added different features.

## Requirements
Unity Editor Version (It may not work in lower versions.)

    2021.2.14f1
    
Odin Inspector (You should add your Odin Inspector to project because of licence issues)
    
## Features
In general, my spline editor has a necessary spline feautures. It has spline controller, clickable points (also spline points and event points exist in hierarchy), spline follower, spline positioner and spline event.
